This project implements the word game Lexicant (superghost), for play against a computer.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicant

Usage:
$ python ghost.py

Note that ghost is currently written in python 2, and not compatible with python 3.
The wordlist is generated via SCOWL (http://wordlist.aspell.net/), with fairly generous parameters and some manual pruning of entries which I thought really weren't words.
